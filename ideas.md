This file will house The ideas that can be used to improve this to-do list

# 1. Save time when task in created
## create 2 lists
    * one for the actual tasks
    * The other to hold the time
        when a task is created, a pararell function gets time from system and saves the time in the time list.
        
        The information of when a task was created can be received by uses of a function that zips the two list.

# 2. Categorize the tasks based on their applicability
## Have lists inside the existing tasks lists.
    * These new lists will be lists for specific categories.
    * One can add task to the general task or even the specified category list.
    * The task creation method will take in two parameters, The category to be placed and the name of the to-do.
    * Accessing them will also have the same effect, Specify the category and task.
